Create a a docker image based on nginx docker image, and publish to Docker Hub into your namespace. 

Default behavior is to get a welcome page that says Welcome to nginx!. 

Change the starting page to say "Welcome to <Your Name> World". So when I pull your image from docker hub and run the command 

docker run -dit -p 80:80 <yournamespace>/nginx:<version>. it should display a new text

 

Default start command - docker run -dit -p 80:80 nginx.
